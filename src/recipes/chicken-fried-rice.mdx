## INGREDIENTS

- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
- 3/4 to 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 1/2 cups frozen peas and diced carrots blend (I don’t thaw and use straight from the freezer)
- 3 green onions, trimmed and sliced into thin rounds
- 2 to 3 garlic cloves, finely minced
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 4 cups cooked rice (I use white, long-grain or brown may be substituted. To save time use two 8.8-ounce pouches cooked and ready-to-serve rice)
- 3 to 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
  salt and pepper, optional and to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. To a large non-stick skillet or wok, add the oils, chicken, and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 to 5 minutes, flipping intermittently so all sides cook evenly. Cooking time will vary based on thickness of chicken breasts and sizes of pieces.
2. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon (allow oils and cooking juices from chicken to remain in skillet) and place chicken on a plate; set aside.
3. Add the peas, carrots, green onions, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften, stir intermittently.
4. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stir intermittently.
5. Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary.
6. Add the chicken, rice, evenly drizzle with soy sauce, optional salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until chicken is reheated through.
