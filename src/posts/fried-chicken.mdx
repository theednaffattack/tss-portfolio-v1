## Ingredients

- 6-8 pieces of chicken (or one 3-pound chicken cut into pieces)
- 48 oz. of peanut oil, or vegetable oil
- 2 cups of all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 ½ teaspoon of garlic powder
- 1 ½ teaspoon of onion powder
- 1 ½ teaspoon of paprika
- ¾ teaspoon of red pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoon of salt
- ¾ teaspoon of black pepper
- 1 egg
- ½ cup of buttermilk (½ cup of buttermilk = ½ cup of milk & ½ tablespoon of apple cider vinegar)

## Directions

1. Instructions for soul food Southern fried chicken recipe
2. Pour the peanut oil (preferred) or vegetable oil into a deep fryer, 6-quart skillet, or Dutch oven until the oil is 1-inch deep.
3. Heat the oil over medium heat or until it reaches 350 degrees F.
4. While you’re waiting for the oil to heat up, Place 1 cup of the divided flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and red pepper in a medium-size mixing bowl or 1-gallon resealable food storage bag.
5. Shake (or mix) the sealed bag to combine the ingredients for a homemade poultry seasoning, and set the flour mixture aside.
6. Pour the second cup of flour into a second resealable bag (or medium-sized mixing bowl) and set it aside.
7. In another medium-sized bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg, and set that mixture aside too.
8. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.

1. First, place the chicken in the bag (or bowl) of seasoned flour and shake or toss to coat the chicken evenly.
2. Second, shake off the excess flour and dip the chicken into the buttermilk mixture.
3. Third, transfer the chicken to the last bag (or bowl) of flour and shake or toss until it’s very well coated.
4. Place the coated chicken into the pre-heated oil, skin-side down, and be careful not to overcrowd the chicken in the oil.
